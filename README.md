<b>Holistic Pediatric Dentistry</b>

Childhood, when permanent teeth began to grow, is the best time to teach youngsters good oral hygiene habits and how to make wise nutritional choices. By learning how to prevent compromising the enamel, the hard substance that covers teeth, children can minimize and perhaps prevent the dental problems that plague many adults.

To this day, there is disagreement in the dental community about the precise cause of tooth decay. The most widely accepted theory is that decay is a local phenomenon, caused when mouth bacteria consume sugar and excrete acid, which begins to decay enamel.


Pediatric tooth decay is on the rise. Some research suggests that systemic causes—including radiation exposure, hormonal abnormalities, and foreign proteins in food are to blame. The systemic theory of decay suggests that other factors become relevant only after hypomineralization has begun.

Tooth decay in children falls into distinct categories:
Baby teeth versus adult teeth
Anterior (front) vs. posterior (back) tooth patterns
Contra-lateral tooth patterns
Decay clustering
Post-eruption susceptibility
A pediatric dental wellness program helps your child to learn the lessons of proper health maintenance and nutritional habits that prevent dental disease. You can bring your child for his or her first dental exam after all the baby teeth are in generally, between ages three and five.

<a href="https://www.holisticdentistrynj.com/our-services/holistic-pediatric-dentistry/">Our pediatric </a> wellness program begins with a three-part, comprehensive exam that checks tooth diagnosis, jaw development diagnosis, and periodontal diagnosis.
The tooth diagnosis assesses tooth development, tooth mineralization, and decay development.
The jaw development diagnosis examines jaw development and alignment of the teeth.
The periodontal diagnosis is an examination for teen gingivitis.
The Center for Systemic Dentistry works to address pediatric dental problems at the earliest stages, remedying the problem and preventing further dental or systemic damage later in your child’s life.
